# Deep Learning Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) System
This repository contains an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system, utilising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data augmentation, gird search, model averaging and Bayesian optimization in MATLAB to effectively recognize and transcribe spoken language. Project extension focuses on spectrogram generation and augmentation, Gaussian noise, L2 Regularisation, and custom voice testing.

Includes pectrogram generation for 1 second .wav files with their relevant audio files.
